<h2 style="font-weight: 600;">STORE LIST WITH STORE MAP</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
  Shoppers are looking for a way to find the closest stores that carry their favorite products. 
</p>
<p>
It's hard to keep track of all the locations and hours of operation for every store in your business network, which is why you need a Store Locator Extension. 
</p>
<p>
This Map Store List extension helps customers find what they're looking for faster by providing them with an easy-to-use interface that allows them to search by location or ZIP code!
</p>
<p>
With this extension, shoppers will be able to see a list of nearby stores along with their addresses and phone number. They'll also have access to Google Maps so they can get directions right from your website! 
</p>
<p>
By offering these features on your site, you'll increase conversion rates and help customers locate exactly what they're searching for more quickly than ever before! 
</p>
<p>
Your customers can choose between visual or text-based searches in order to find exactly what they're looking for. If they prefer visuals, then simply click on the map icon and choose from hundreds of stores near them! 
</p>
<p>
Or if they'd rather search by typing in their ZIP code, state/country range, or city name - it's all up to them! You'll be able to offer both options while keeping things organized and simple for your shoppers.

<h2>AUTOMATIC GEOLOCATION DETECTION</h2>
<ul>
<p>
Locating the store nearest you is a pain.
</p>
<p>
 Most websites only offer an address and a phone number, which means that customers have to look up the location of each nearby store on their own before they can decide where to go. That’s time-consuming and inconvenient!
</p>
<p>
 The Magento 2 Store Locator with Google Maps uses the user location and determines the precise geographic coordinates, so you know exactly where the closest stores are without having to search through dozens of irrelevant results.
</p>
<p>
This saves you time and makes it easier than ever for shoppers to find what they want. You can even use our locator map widget on your website or blog as well!

<h2>SHOW CLOSEST LOCATIONS</h2>
<ul>
<p>
The Magento 2 Dealer Locator Page lists all of the designated stores that are within a close radius of you when inputting a specific store or location search.
</p>
<p>
The problem with most store locator pages is that they are difficult to use and don’t provide the information you need.
</p>
<p>
Most store locators lack detailed search filters, which means it takes longer for customers to find what they want, if at all. This leads to more customer frustration and less sales.
</p>
<p>
We have created a simple-to-use store locator page that allows users to filter their results by city or state in addition to distance from their current location. Our page also allows them to input a specific address as well as view stores on a map of the area around them!

<h2>CUSTOM MAP PINSS</h2>

<h2>STORE DETAIL PAGE</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
It's hard to get customers to visit your store. 
</p>
<p>
 We all know that foot traffic is important, but how do you make sure people come in and browse? There are a lot of stores out there and most products are the same. How can you stand out from the crowd?
</p>
<p>
 Store Detail Page solves this problem by providing an online experience similar to what they would have if they were visiting a physical location. Here, we provide them with everything they need such as directions, contact information, photos and more! 
</p>
<p>
This way when potential customers search for something close by or type in their zip code on Google Maps - our website will be one of the first results because it's so useful!
</p>
<p>
Personalization services such as Sailthru, Nosto, etc. can be integrated with the Store Locator page to display dynamic banners with products targeted at individual customer profiles. This increases both in-store traffic and company profit!

<h2>UNIFIED SOCIAL MEDIA INTEGRATION</h2>

<h2>MAGENTO 2 STORE LOCATOR EXTENSION FREE TRIAL WITH CATEGORY FILTERING</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
    Your store may include many differently-minded locations, such as flagship stores and pop-up shops. But whether it’s a flagship or pop-up location, your customers ask the same questions: Can I get returns? Will there be special events in the near future? Sort all of your locations by type to make this process easier for both your customers and your store associates. 
  </p>
  <p>
These attributes and more can be filtered so customers won't travel to the wrong location. If your business has many locations, chances are they're not all alike.

  Managing multiple locations can be a pain.

We all know that managing multiple locations is hard, but it doesn’t have to be. There are tons of solutions out there for large chains, but what about the small business owners who only run one or two stores? They get left behind and end up wasting time on tasks that they could spend doing something else more valuable.
</p>
<p>
MANAGE ALL YOUR LOCATIONS IN ONE PLACE! Our software takes care of everything you need to manage your store(s). You simply upload a simple CSV file with basic information and we take care of the rest! It's as easy as 1-2-3!

<h2>HOW TO INSTALL THE MAGENTO 2 STORE LOCATOR PLUGIN.</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
Step 1:
Before installing the Store Locator Magento 2 Extension Free Trial, please check the extension compatibility. This extension is currently compatible with the following Magento versions: 2.0.X. - 2.4.x. It’s recommended to install the extension on a dev server before installing it on a live (production) server.
</p>
<p>
Step 2:
Copy the extension files to below paths of your magento 2 instance. If ‘app/code/WeSupply’ folder is missing, please create it manually:
app/code/WeSupply/Toolbox
</p>
<p>
Step 3:
Access the root of your magento 2 project from command line and run the following commands:
    <p>
      <strong>php bin/magento module:enable WeSupply_Toolbox --clear-static-content</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>php bin/magento setup:upgrade</strong>
</p>
<p>
Step 4:
Flush any cache that you might still have enabled on your server or in Magento.
</p>
<p>
Step 5:
Woohoo, the extension is installed!
</p>

<h2>HOW TO UPGRADE THE EXTENSION.</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
    Step 1: Remove extension code under app/code/WeSupply/Toolbox before adding the new extension files. The extension may be refactored and old unused files may cause random issues so it's best to only keep the latest version of the files.
  </p>
  <p>
    Step 2: Follow normal installation instructions above.
